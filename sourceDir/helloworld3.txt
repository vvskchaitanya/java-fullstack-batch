However, Hogan helped forge a link between tobacco and Formula One's growing presence on television.[1] He said that while Imperial Tobacco was "a British company and happy to be at the British GP ... [Marlboro] wanted to be global."[17] European governments began outlawing tobacco television commercials in the late 1960s.[14] Including corporate decals on an F1 car's livery allowed tobacco companies to get their brands on television without violating the ban on purchasing ad time, and Hogan explained that he saw F1 as a way "to make ourselves visible ... before the black curtain came down".[17] In the analogous context of IndyCar, during the 1989 Marlboro Grand Prix, it was calculated that Marlboro's name was spoken or shown 5,933 times in 94 minutes, and that Marlboro's name was on television for 46 of those minutes.[18]

Other tobacco companies followed PM and Imperial's lead, "driv[ing] Formula One into an era where big-name corporate sponsors were essential to fund technological advances and soaring salaries".[1] Tobacco money became so influential in Formula One that in 2005, journalist Dieter Rencken found that every World Drivers' Champion since 1984 had been sponsored by a tobacco company.[13] Formula One Group chief Bernie Ecclestone told Tony Blair that no other industry would match tobacco's financial commitment to the sport, prompting Blair to (unsuccessfully) ask European authorities to exempt F1 from tobacco advertising restrictions.[19][20] In addition, Marlboro and Elf's financial clout allowed the two sponsors to play peacemaker during the FISA–FOCA war.[21] With sponsorships on both sides of the conflict (Marlboro was the title sponsor for both the FOCA-affiliated McLaren and the FISA-affiliated Alfa Romeo in the early 1980s), Marlboro took "an inevitable neutral line",[22] but Hogan pushed the parties to reach a compromise.[23]

To avoid European restrictions on cigarette advertising, which required F1 teams to blank out tobacco decals on their liveries, cigarette brands like Marlboro encouraged Formula One to race in new markets like Bahrain.[24] (Left: Photo of Michael Schumacher's Ferrari at the 2003 British Grand Prix.

The tobacco industry also engineered Formula One's emergence as a global competition—once again in response to European crackdowns on cigarette advertising in F1. France adopted a law restricting tobacco marketing at sporting events (the loi Évin) in 1991, and other European countries eventually passed similar laws.[19] In response, F1 added many non-European circuits to the race calendar,[24] aided by the tobacco companies, which (according to FIA president Max Mosley) put up the money to build new circuits in the Far East.[19] In addition, European countries that imposed nominal fines for tobacco advertising, like Italy,[19] were rewarded with multiple races per year.[24]

Hogan also worked with Ecclestone to market Formula One around the world; he was credited with the invention of grid girls.[1][25] In addition, he was chosen to represent F1's sponsors on the FIA's F1 Commission,[2][6] which wrote the rules for the sport.[1]

Drivers as marketing sensations
Hogan is perhaps best known for his patronage of James Hunt, the 1976 Formula One World Champion. He got to know Hunt before joining Marlboro, having subsidised Hunt's junior career during his years at Erwin Wasey.[9][6] The 28-year-old Hogan cobbled together $2,000 (which he called "a fortune in those days") from Coca-Cola and Rose Bearings so that Hunt could compete in the 1971 British Formula Three season.[26] The two drivers became good friends.[27] Although Hogan found Hunt's personality frustrating to deal with as a businessman, Hunt was a heavy smoker with a glamorous lifestyle, making him an ideal pitchman for the sport.[17]

Hogan was credited with steering Hunt to the Marlboro McLaren team, where he achieved his greatest successes. Emerson Fittipaldi abruptly left the team before the 1976 season.[28] The two contenders for his race seat were Hunt and Jacky Ickx.[9] Although McLaren's other sponsor Texaco wanted Ickx, team manager Alastair Caldwell said that Hogan essentially "forced" Hunt into the team.[29] However, Hogan's true role in recruiting Hunt is unclear. He told Hunt's biographer that Ickx "was past his peak" and that he had wanted Hunt all along.[30] However, in 2018, he said that he had wanted to sign Ickx, and that other decisionmakers at McLaren chose Hunt.[31] In any event, Hogan drove a hard bargain with Hunt, offering him an incentive-based contract with a guaranteed salary of just $50,000, one-fifth of what McLaren had been paying Fittipaldi.[32] By contrast, Hogan offered Wolf-Williams Racing up to £100,000 to sign Ickx for 1976.[33]

The two friends did not always see eye to eye as businessmen. Hunt refused to give up smoking Rothmans cigarettes, although he agreed to pretend to smoke Marlboros.[1] In addition, Hunt declined Hogan's request to wear a jacket and tie at sponsor events,[1][34] and angered Hogan by secretly signing another sponsorship deal with Olympus.[35] Despite these tics in the relationship, Hogan foresaw that Hunt could establish a fierce rivalry with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. He told his bosses at Marlboro that Hunt could generate "a good story—the Brit against the German."[36]

After joining McLaren, Hunt immediately took the fight to Lauda, generating major exposure for Marlboro. The two drivers battled for the 1976 title until the end of the season. Hunt's massive popularity made him must-see television in the United Kingdom, and even broke the British Broadcasting Corporation's attempt to boycott the sport.[37] When Hunt won the 1976 title, Hogan paid for a long string of parties, sponsor events, and press interviews.[38] Marlboro's European sales increased significantly after Hunt's victory.[39] The publicity value from the title race was estimated at as much as $500 million.[40]

Creating the modern-day superheroes
Although Hunt never won another title, Hogan continued finding and sponsoring championship drivers. To maximise Marlboro's exposure on television, he hired ad men who "deliberately attempted to elevate the principal drivers from mere heroes to superhero status".[41] Autoweek's Joe Saward wrote that Hogan, Bernie Ecclestone, and Elf's François Guiter were "the primary forces in creating modern F1, not only by providing money for the sport, but also by putting together great teams".[6]

Under Hogan, PM set up the Marlboro World Championship Team, a predecessor of the modern-day driver academy, to provide financial support to promising junior drivers.[6] After Hunt retired, Hogan hired him as an advisor and driver coach.[42][43] Many of the best Marlboro-sponsored drivers got their starts at McLaren, which was Marlboro's flagship team for most of Hogan's career.
